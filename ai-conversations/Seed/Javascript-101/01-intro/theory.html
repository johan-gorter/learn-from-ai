  <h1>1. Introduction to Programming and JavaScript</h1>

  <h2>Theory</h2>
  <p>Programming is the art of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. It's like writing a recipe
    for a computer to follow. Just as we use different languages to communicate with people, we use programming
    languages to communicate with computers.</p>

  <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, especially for web development. It was created to make
    websites interactive and dynamic. Unlike some other languages, JavaScript runs directly in web browsers, making it
    an excellent choice for beginners to start their programming journey.</p>

  <p>Learning JavaScript opens up many opportunities. You can create interactive websites, build web applications, and
    even develop mobile apps or server-side programs. It's a versatile language that's relatively easy to learn but
    powerful enough to build complex applications.</p>

  <h2>Example: Hello, World!</h2>
  <p>Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program. This simple program displays a greeting message and is often
    the first program people write when learning a new language.</p>

  <pre><code>
console.log("Hello, World!");
  </code></pre>

  <p>In this example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>console.log()</code> is a JavaScript function that outputs a message to the console (a text-based
      interface for displaying messages).</li>
    <li>The message "Hello, World!" is enclosed in quotes, indicating it's a string (a sequence of characters).</li>
    <li>The semicolon (;) at the end marks the end of the statement.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When you run this code, you'll see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in the console.</p>
