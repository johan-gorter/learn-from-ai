Our application needs the following tables:
course, subject, excercise, that fit the data

how do I keep an explicit ordering for excercises and subjects?

Create a markdown file which describes all tables and relations in the database. Include the User table from Identity. Describe the fields used in relations with their data type.

@ApplicationDbContext.cs @db.md Add tables for the following functionality:
Keep an audit log with entries when a user starts a subject or excercise. Also add an entry when a user comples an excercise or skips it.


Add migrations to seed @course.json , @excercise-a.html and @theory.html into the database
