What CSS frameworks can render an interactive pages with these contents in a styled, accessible modern and semantic way? I already tried bootstrap, bulma, mui, tailwind, shoelace.

For rendering interactive pages with styled, accessible, modern, and semantic content, there are several CSS frameworks that could be suitable alternatives to the ones you've already tried. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Foundation: A responsive front-end framework that's known for its flexibility and accessibility features.
2. Semantic UI: Offers a human-friendly HTML and intuitive JavaScript, with a focus on readability and ease of use.
3. UIkit: A lightweight and modular framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.
4. Chakra UI: A simple, modular, and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks to build React applications.
5. Primer: GitHub's CSS framework, which is designed to be accessible and customizable.
6. Milligram: A minimalist CSS framework that's lightweight and easy to use.
7. Pure.css: A set of small, responsive CSS modules that you can use in every web project.
8. Spectre: A lightweight, responsive and modern CSS framework for faster and extensible development.
9. Tachyons: Functional CSS for humans, allowing you to build and design without writing custom CSS.
10. Water.css: A drop-in collection of CSS styles to make simple websites just a little nicer.

These frameworks offer various levels of complexity and features. Some, like Foundation and Semantic UI, are more comprehensive, while others like Milligram and Water.css are more lightweight. The choice depends on your specific needs, the level of customization you require, and the complexity of your project.
